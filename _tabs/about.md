Hi there,ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Herald. I'm a Network Automation Engineer who loves playing with words and IT.  I believe in technology which can change the world for good and make lives better. Currently, I am working ðŸŒ± with automation and DevOps technologies in the field of networking. 

From childhood, I always love to maintain notes with the topics I learn daily, and feel confident about my understanding. I believe in Albert Einstein's philosophy 


> If you canâ€™t explain it simply, you donâ€™t understand it well enough.


The main purpose of this blog is to document my learning experiences and to write clear and crisp articles which help others as well. 

In this blog, I discuss Linux, Python, Networking, Automation, DevOps, and other IT-related topics. I hope these articles are useful to you. If they are, please consider sharing them.

Moreover, I love Nature, reading, and learning new things daily!ðŸ˜‰. Thanks for your time I hope that you will enjoy my blog!ðŸ˜Š
